Problem Statement: Vehicle Rental System

You are tasked with developing a vehicle rental system for a company that offers various types of vehicles for rent, including cars, bikes, and trucks. The system should allow customers to rent vehicles, return them, and manage their rentals efficiently.

Inputs:

Vehicle Information: The system should store information about each vehicle, including its type (car, bike, truck), model, make, year of manufacture, rental rate per day, availability status, etc.

Customer Information: Maintain a database of customer information, including their name, contact details, driver's license information, etc.

Rental Records: Track rental records, including the vehicle rented, rental start date, rental duration, total rental cost, customer details, etc.

Methods:

Add Vehicle: Add a new vehicle to the system with relevant details such as type, model, make, rental rate, etc.

Remove Vehicle: Remove a vehicle from the system. This should update the availability status and remove any associated rental records.

Rent Vehicle: Allow a customer to rent a vehicle. Check the availability of the vehicle, calculate the rental cost based on the rental duration and rate, update the availability status, and create a rental record.

Return Vehicle: Enable customers to return rented vehicles. Update the availability status, calculate the total rental cost, update the rental record with return date and time, and generate an invoice if needed.

Check Availability: Check the availability of a specific type of vehicle for a given date range.

Generate Rental Report: Generate reports such as total revenue, most rented vehicles, least rented vehicles, etc., to analyze the business performance.

Customer Management: Add, update, or remove customer information from the system.

Vehicle Maintenance: Track vehicle maintenance schedules, including service dates, repairs, and maintenance costs.

Discounts and Promotions: Implement discounts or promotional offers for long-term rentals, repeat customers, etc.

Billing and Payment: Calculate rental charges, generate invoices, and handle payment transactions securely.

Authentication and Authorization: Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access and perform certain actions within the system.

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to handle scenarios such as invalid inputs, unavailable vehicles, payment failures, etc.

Constraints:

The system should be user-friendly and intuitive to use.
Ensure data consistency and integrity by validating inputs and performing appropriate error checks.
Handle concurrent access to the system to prevent data corruption and inconsistencies.
Ensure data security and privacy by implementing proper access controls and encryption mechanisms.
Bonus Features (Optional):

Integration with GPS tracking systems to track vehicle locations in real-time.
Mobile application support for customers to browse available vehicles, make reservations, and manage their rentals.
Integration with online payment gateways for seamless payment processing.
Loyalty program implementation to reward frequent customers with discounts or other benefits.
